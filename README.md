# The system
scratch note for quick intake/capture

Daily review to process scratch

Weekly review to prep for next day/week

Backlog contains prioritized list of individual tasks and projects

A project is a set of related tasks and any notes (might just link to reference notes if applicable)

## Task intake/capture
> What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important.
> Dwight Eisenhower

*Urgent tasks - that you feel like you need to react to
Important tasks - things that contribute to our long-term mission, values, and goals
The fastest way to get something done is to eliminate that task entirely*

1. Urgent & Important - Do (today/interrupt)
2. !Urgent & Important - Decide (backlog/scheduled)
3. Urgent & !Important - Delegate (delegate backlog)
4. !Urgent & !Important - Delete (don't do...)
